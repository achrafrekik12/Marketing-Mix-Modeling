# Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) Project

This repository contains an end-to-end implementation of a Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) project conducted using Microsoft Excel and Python. The project focuses on analyzing and optimizing advertising spend across multiple channels to improve sales forecasts and maximize ROI.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Overview

Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) is a statistical technique used to estimate the impact of various marketing inputs on sales and to optimize marketing budgets. This project applies advanced modeling techniques, including adstock transformations, diminishing returns, and logarithmic scaling, to analyze advertising data from Facebook, TV, and Radio.

The repository contains both:
- **Excel Implementation**: For hands-on modeling, simulations, and dashboard creation.
- **Python Code**: For replicating the Excel workflow programmatically, enabling automation and scalability.

## ðŸ“Š Key Features and Deliverables

- **Data Analysis**: Cleaned and preprocessed raw data for analysis, including sales and advertising metrics.
- **Regression Modeling**: Developed linear regression models, integrating transformed variables (e.g., adstock, diminishing returns).
- **Scenario Simulation**: Built a dynamic Excel-based simulator and Python scripts for real-time budget allocation and ROI optimization.
- **Model Validation**: Evaluated performance using statistical metrics like MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error).
- **Dashboard Creation**: Designed interactive visualizations in Excel, alongside programmatic analysis in Python.
